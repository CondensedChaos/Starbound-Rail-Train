Starbound Rail Train system
===========================

# Overview

This mod add a train system to be used with Startbound's rail tram system.
It provides a framework that includes train crafting, personalization of trains, creation of lines and scheduling of trains.

There are two operating modes, free and scheduled.

## Free Mode

In free mode the trains are crafted using the **Train Configurator** (crafted at Rail Crafting Table) and just placed on the rails.
Once the train is placed it will continue to go over the rails and stops at stations, you can either make a circular rail line around the planet or use rail bumbers to revert its direction so it goes back and forth.
To create stops you need to use the custom rail markers (called **"Rail station marker"**, craftable at the Rail Crafting Table) supplied with the mod (**_do not use conventional vanilla tram stops_**).
Since the game loads the world in *"chunks"* that are approximately 20x20 blocks, you will need special items to place on the rail every 19 tiles that will keep that tract of world loaded (similar to Minecraft "Chunks Loaders")
There are two variants of chunk loaders, they're only different in appearance but they serve the same functions: **"catenaries"** and **"rail chunk loaders"**

## Scheduled mode
